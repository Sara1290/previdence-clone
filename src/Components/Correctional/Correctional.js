            Individuals who are incarcerated, or who are on parole or probation,
            stand in need of care. Previdence assessments can help identify
            suicidal and homicidal tendencies, drug and alcohol abuse, sexual
            improprieties, and more. Doing so can help these individuals, as
            well as help keep communities safer.
